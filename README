This Python program is under  construction.  It will convert plain
text books to Kindle .mobi format.  Later on more outputs  will be
available like PDF (Using LaTeX),  EPUB.  Moreover it will be able
to typeset plain text (txt2txt).

It will make  writers easy  to publish their material on Amazon or
make a print-reasy version of them with just one click, if the im‐
put plain text is  well formatted.  I reworked the necessary input
format  syntax several  times and came up  with an extremely plain
and  easy one:  The writer can write the text as if he would use a
classic  typewriter.  No fancy statements and declarations are ne‐
cessary.
