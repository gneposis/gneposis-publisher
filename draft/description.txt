((1,0),(0,0)) DOCUMENT FILE:
According to Rule 1-2 I defined the following input format:

There are only three wildcard characters:

{ } _

The first two are reserved for statements, the third to emphasize something like in plain text books of the Project Gutenberg.

Statements are in {}-s.

The first part of the statement declares its type. The first space separates it from the second part (if any). The second part is the argument part.

In the argument part '::' separates the individual arguments and '<...>' stands for an optional argument.

We define the following categories of statements:
1. Escape statements
    1. {{} for {
    2. {}} for }
    3. {_} for _
2. Common statements
    1. {/} for end an environmental statement
3. Meta statements
    1. {AUTHOR name :: <sort_name>}
    2. {DATE year :: <month> :: <day>}
    3. {DESCRIPTION} \n ...
    4. {TITLE title :: <subtitle>}
    5. {ISBN isbn}
4. Division statements
    1. {BOOK title :: <subtitle>} \n ...
    2. {PART title :: <subtitle>} \n ...
    3. {CHAPTER title :: <subtitle>} \n ...
    4. {SECTION title :: <subtitle>} \n ...
    5. {PARAGRAPH title} \n ...
    6. {***}
